/=We now add the text of the sections.  Note first that I have not completed all of the choices in the text.  Then note that:<ol><li>The defined terms are links to the definitions.  This aids the reader and reduces errors by the draftsperson.<li>The cross-references are links to the sections.  These are correctly numbered as part of the organization of the outline.  (Look in Form/MSA/Deep14 for key/values with "Xref" and "Xnum." In the actual text, we make the references semantically as "{Tribunal.Xref" or {CustomerObligation.Xref}.  The outline matches the right number.  This means that the text can be reused in many different outlines.  It also helps the author to focus on meaning rather than chasing after numbers.<li>A number of alternative phrasings are available. Click on "xEdit" to see these presented with an interface that lets you make choices.<li>A number of variables are also parameterized.  In eEdit, you can fill that information and save it.  (Pick a name, and don't be shy about trying this.  The website will save it, but only temporarily.</ol>
