4.6.3.sec=negotiates in good faith  with Provider to resolve the dispute. If the Customer disputes any portion of an invoice that is based upon Service usage or availability, then Provider's records of such usage or availability shall be presumed to be accurate unless proved otherwise by an independent auditor.

4.7.Ti=Taxes

4.7.sec=All Charges are calculated exclusive of any tax, surcharge, fee, duty, VAT (or other sales tax), excise or similar charge or liability (together “Taxes”), whether charged to Provider or the Customer, based on the provision of the Service to the Customer and/or the Customer’s use of the Service. The Customer is responsible for payment of all Taxes.  VAT will be invoiced in accordance with statutory requirements for such tax and shall be payable, subject to receipt by the Customer of a valid VAT invoice. If the Customer is required to pay a Tax pursuant to this clause 4.7, then the Customer shall pay such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by Provider after all such payments or withholdings equal the amount to which Provider is otherwise entitled to under the Agreement as if such Taxes did not exist.

4.8.Ti=Fraudulent Use

4.8.sec=The Customer will be responsible for all Charges incurred in respect of the Service even if such Charges were incurred through, or as a result of, fraudulent or unauthorised use of the Service. Provider may, but is not obliged to, detect unauthorised or fraudulent use of the Service.

5.Ti=DELIVERY OF SERVICES

5.1.Ti=Delivery

5.1.sec=Provider shall use reasonable commercial endeavours to meet the Service delivery date requested by the Customer in the Customer Order.
5.2.Ti=Tail Circuits. If the Customer requests, Provider will procure a Tail Circuit required for delivery of a Service. In such case, the  Customer acknowledges that: (a) the Tail Circuit(s) will be manufactured and provided by a third party operator; (b) the Tail Circuit(s) will function and perform in accordance with the service level undertakings provided by the third party operator which provides the Tail Circuit(s); (c) any rights, remedies, credits or service the Customer may have or be entitled to regarding a Tail Circuit are limited to those rights, remedies, credits or service provided by the third party operator or manufacturer of the Tail Circuit; (d) the third party estimated costs for the Tail  Circuit  are incorporated within the Charges and are subject to survey of the Customer’s Site by the third party and may be subject to change, both upwards and downwards, any such change to be passed on to the Customer in its entirety; and (e) if the Customer cancels the Service prior to the conclusion of the Service Term, then the Customer will pay any and all cancellation charges  that Provider owes to third parties in respect of the Tail Circuit(s). Where the Customer Order indicates that a Tail Circuit is to be provided by the Customer (a “Customer Tail Circuit”), then the Customer will procure and be solely responsible
 

 
for the Customer Tail Circuit. Provider will have no liability whatsoever in respect of the provision or functioning of a Customer Tail Circuit and the Customer will indemnify and hold Provider harmless from any claims, costs, expenses, damages and losses arising from the provision or functioning of any Customer Tail Circuit.
5.3.Ti=Modifications. Provider reserves the right to change the terms, specifications and/or conditions of a Service upon not less than 30 days advance notice to the Customer other than where such changes are being made as a consequence of governmental or regulatory action, in which case Provider shall give as much notice as is practicable in the circumstances.  If Provider changes a Service in a manner materially adverse to the  Customer, then the Customer may cancel such Service without penalty within 10 Business Days of the change by providing written notice to Provider. Such cancellation shall take effect 30 days from the date of the Customer’s notice of cancellation. Otherwise, the Customer’s continued use of such Service constitutes the Customer’s acceptance of any changes. In the case of governmental or regulatory action, Provider shall also have the right to cancel a Service or alter the terms and conditions of the Agreement, if, in its reasonable judgement, the action will make provision of such Service more expensive or difficult, substantially impaired or difficult. In the case of such action, Provider shall also have the right to pass through and to invoice to the Customer, on a pro rata basis, any new or increased fees, assessments, Taxes or other charges imposed on, or required to be collected by Provider, by any governmental agency.
6.Ti=SOFTWARE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
6.1.Ti=Licence. If Provider provides the Customer with software for use in connection with any Service, then the Customer will have a non-exclusive, non- transferable, revocable (for breach only) licence to use such software solely for its own internal use to the extent necessary to use the Service. Such licence shall not entitle the Customer to claim title to, or any ownership interest in, the software (or any derivations or improvements thereto) and the Customer will execute any documentation reasonably required by Provider to document Provider’s existing and continued ownership of, or right to, the software.
6.2.Ti=Restrictions. The Customer agrees that it will not and will not permit others to: (a) copy the software except as permitted by Provider, except as reasonably required for backup purposes; (b) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software save to the extent that it cannot be prohibited from so doing under applicable law; (c) sell, lease, license or sub-license the software; (d) create, write or develop any derivative software or any other software program based on the licensed software or any Confidential Information of Provider; or (e) take any action prohibited by the owner of the software.

The Customer shall comply at all times with the operating procedures and interconnection requirements of Provider. The Customer warrants that the content it or its end- users make available through a Service will not:
(a)	include any indecent, offensive or obscene material; 
(b) constitute a defamation or libel of Provider, its Group companies or any third party; or
(c) result in any liability of Provider or its Group companies to any third party.
7.2.Ti=Access. The Customer agrees to cooperate with and assist Provider in carrying out Provider’s obligations under the Agreement, including without limitation, providing Provider and its agents access to the Customer Sites to the extent reasonably requested




consents from third parties necessary to allow Provider such access. If the Customer fails to provide Provider access or access rights required under the Agreement in order for Provider to deliver the Service, then the Customer will pay all Charges for such Service from and after the date Provider is otherwise ready to deliver them. In addition, Provider shall not be liable for any failure to provide Service to the extent that such failure is due to Provider being denied access to the Customer Sites.
7.3.Ti=Customer Site. The Customer shall provide and maintain, at its own expense, the level of power, heating and air conditioning necessary to maintain the proper environment for the Equipment on the Customer Site. The Customer will comply with all laws and regulations regarding the working conditions on the Customer Site.
7.4.Ti=Content. The Customer warrants that it will not use the Service in any manner which: (a) violates any applicable law, rule or regulation;  (b) breaches Provider’s acceptable use policy (as may be amended by Provider from time to time and which is available on www.Provider.com); or (c) infringes or contains any content that infringes the rights of others, including without limitation, any copyright, patent, trade mark, trade secret, privacy or proprietary right. The Customer  acknowledges that: (a) Provider does not monitor and will have no liability or responsibility for the content of any communications transmitted via the Service; or
(b) it is responsible for implementing any desired security mechanisms as network security is not provided by Provider as part of the Service.
8.Ti=CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
8.1.Ti=Disclosure and Use. The parties will keep in strict confidence all information (whether written
 

 
or oral) of a confidential nature obtained from the other party under the Agreement (“Confidential Information”). Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any person (other than their employees who need to know the information for the purpose of the Agreement and who are under an equivalent duty of confidentiality) without the prior written consent of the other party. Each party shall: (a) use the other party’s Confidential Information only for the performance of its obligations under the Agreement; (b) treat all Confidential Information of the other party in the same manner as it treats its own, but in no case with less than reasonable care; and (c) not make copies of the other party’s Confidential Information.
8.2.Ti=Exceptions. Clause 8.1 will not apply to information which: (a) is publicly available other than through a breach of the Agreement; (b) is lawfully in the possession of the recipient before disclosure by the other party and is not otherwise subject to a confidentiality undertaking; (c) is obtained through a third party who is free to disclose it; or (d) is required by law to be disclosed (and then, to the extent legally permissible, only after reasonable advance notice to the disclosing party).
8.3.Ti=Publicity. Neither party may use the other party's trade marks, service marks or trade names (“Marks”) or otherwise refer to the other party without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, in the case of marketing, promotional or advertising materials or activities. Each party’s Marks are proprietary to such party and nothing in the Agreement constitutes the grant of a general licence for their use. Upon termination of this MSA or delivery of written notice by a party, all rights of the other party to use such party’s Marks shall expire. Either party may issue a press release relating to, or otherwise disclose the existence of, the contractual relationship between the parties.
9.Ti=TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION
9.1.Ti=Termination by the Customer. The Customer may terminate the Agreement without liability on
30 days written notice to Provider if: (a) Provider commits a material breach of the Agreement and, in the case of a breach capable of remedy has not cured such breach or omission within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the Customer; or (b) Provider suffers or undergoes an Event of Insolvency.
9.2.Ti=Termination or Suspension by Provider. Provider may terminate the Agreement and/or  cease or suspend the provision of Service upon written notice to the Customer if: (a) the Customer fails to pay any Charges when due and does not cure the failure within 5 days of the notice; (b) the Customer's unpaid balance or use of the Service exceeds the Customer's credit limit (if any); (c) if the Customer commits a breach of clause 7; (d) the Customer commits a breach of the Agreement
 
(other than a non-payment or clause 7 breach) and does not cure such breach within 10 days of written notice from Provider; (e) the Customer makes a material misrepresentation in any submission to Provider; (f) the Customer suffers or undergoes an Event of Insolvency; or (g) the provision of Service is determined by any governmental or legal authority to be contrary to any law, rule, policy or regulation.
9.3.Ti=Cancellation Charges. If the Customer cancels a Service prior to the conclusion of its Service Term, then the Customer shall pay to Provider all Charges for the Service provided up until the effective date of such cancellation plus a cancellation charge as follows: (a) if the Service is cancelled after the Agreement is signed but prior to the Service Commencement Date, then the cancellation charge will be an amount equal to 2 months’ recurring Service Charge; and (b) if the Service is cancelled after the Service Commencement Date but prior to the end of the Service Term, then the cancellation charge will be an amount equal to 100% of the monthly recurring Service Charges which would have been due to Provider during the Service Term. All cancellation charges shall be paid within 5 days of receipt of invoice. Both parties acknowledge and agree that the above cancellation charges are a genuine pre-estimate of Provider’s loss in the event that the Customer were to terminate a Service prior to the end of the Service Term and that they are not intended as a penalty. The cancellation charges provided in this clause 9.3 shall not apply if the Customer cancels a Service pursuant to clause 5.3 or clause 9.1.
9.4.Ti=Obligations upon Termination or Suspension. Neither the termination of the Agreement nor the suspension or cancellation of any Service for any reason shall relieve the Customer of its obligation to pay all Charges for Service accrued and owing up to and including the date of termination, suspension or cancellation or otherwise payable pursuant to  the Agreement. In addition, such termination, suspension or cancellation shall not preclude Provider from pursuing any other remedies available to it at law or in equity. If Provider has terminated this MSA or suspended or terminated any Service or Agreement, then the Customer agrees to pay Provider a reconnection fee, if Provider agrees to reactivate the Service. The amount of any such reconnection fee shall be determined by Provider at its sole discretion.
