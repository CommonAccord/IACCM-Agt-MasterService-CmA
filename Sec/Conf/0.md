Ti=Confidential Information

1.Ti=Disclosure and Use

1.sec=The parties will keep in strict confidence all information (whether written or oral) of a confidential nature obtained from the other party under the {_Agreement} (“{Def.Confidential_Information.sec}”). Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s {_Confidential_Information} to any person (other than their employees who need to know the information for the purpose of the {_Agreement} and who are under an equivalent duty of confidentiality) without the prior written consent of the other party. Each party shall: (a) use the other party’s {_Confidential_Information} only for the performance of its obligations under the {_Agreement}; (b) treat all {_Confidential_Information} of the other party in the same manner as it treats its own, but in no case with less than reasonable care; and (c) not make copies of the other party’s {_Confidential_Information}.

2.Ti=Exceptions

2.sec={Conf.Xref}.1 will not apply to information which: (a) is publicly available other than through a breach of the {_Agreement}; (b) is lawfully in the possession of the recipient before disclosure by the other party and is not otherwise subject to a confidentiality undertaking; (c) is obtained through a third party who is free to disclose it; or (d) is required by law to be disclosed (and then, to the extent legally permissible, only after reasonable advance notice to the disclosing party).

3.Ti=Publicity

3.sec=Neither party may use the other party's trade marks, service marks or trade names (“{Def.Mark.sec}s”) or otherwise refer to the other party without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, in the case of marketing, promotional or advertising materials or activities. Each party’s {_Marks} are proprietary to such party and nothing in the {_Agreement} constitutes the grant of a general licence for their use. Upon termination of this {_MSA} or delivery of written notice by a party, all rights of the other party to use such party’s {_Marks} shall expire. Either party may issue a press release relating to, or otherwise disclose the existence of, the contractual relationship between the parties.
